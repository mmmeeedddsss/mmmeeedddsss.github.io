I'm Mert Tun√ß.

I received my Computer Engineering degree from Middle East Technical University located in Ankara Turkey.
I also completed a MS degree in the same department on explainable recommendations.

I currently work at Udemy as a Staff Software Engineer inside the data organization.

I usually encounter some problems that I can not trivially solve and for some of them,
it seems to me that it is also not easy to find answers online with my own explanation of the problem.
I decided to open this blog to mention such problems and how I find the solution of these with a wish that maybe the notes here might help some others one day!
